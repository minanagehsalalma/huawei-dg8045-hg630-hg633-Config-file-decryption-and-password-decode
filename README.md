# huawei-dg8045-hg630-hg633-Config-file-decryption&encryption-and-password-decode

Usage :`dg8045.py decrypt inputfile outputfile
`

It cannot encrypt the config file because the signatures are missing 

It decrypts the encrypted passwords too 

the Userpassword is stored as an encrypted string that when decrypted
outputs a SHA-1 hash

made from the password and the salt from the config file 

To create it 

`import hashlib`

`
t = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac('sha1', b'thepassword', b'salt', 1000, 16).hex()
`


`
print(t)`

# hg630/hg633 decryption&encryption 

decryption :

Usage :`hg633.py decrypt inputfile outputfile
`

encryption : 

Usage :`hg633.py encrypt inputfile outputfile
`

To decode the encrypted passwords 

Usage :`hg633decode.py decrypt inputfile outputfile
`

note that you can only encrypt the config file generated by hg633.py not hg633decode.py because of the decoded passwords 

it decodes almost all the passwords expect the admin cause the needed IV is different for each ISP 

To manually decrypt passwords 

Usage : `sdecode.py encryptedstring
`
